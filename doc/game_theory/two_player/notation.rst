   * - .. centered:: Variable
     - .. centered:: Type
     - Description
   * - .. centered:: :math:`\boldsymbol{s}_{h,k}``
     - .. centered:: Vector
     - A `pure-strategy profile` for a 2-player game that assigns pure strategy
       :math:`\mathit{h}` to player position one and pure strategy
       :math:`\mathit{k}` to player position two.
   * - .. centered:: :math:`\boldsymbol{A}`
     - .. centered:: Matrix
     - The `payoff matrix` for player position one in a two player normal
       form game.
   * - .. centered:: :math:`a_{h,k}`
     - .. centered:: Scalar
     - The payoff specified by `payoff matrix` :math:`\boldsymbol{A}`
       when player position one uses pure strategy :math:`\mathit{h}`
       and player position two uses pure strategy :math:`\mathit{k}`
   * - .. centered:: :math:`\boldsymbol{B}`
     - .. centered:: Matrix
     - The `payoff matrix` for player position two in a two player normal
       form game.
   * - .. centered:: :math:`b_{h,k}`
     - .. centered:: Scalar
     - The payoff specified by `payoff matrix` :math:`\boldsymbol{B}`
       when player position one uses pure strategy :math:`\mathit{h}`
       and player position two uses pure strategy :math:`\mathit{k}`
   * - .. centered:: :math:`\boldsymbol{\chi}_{\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{y}}`
     - .. centered:: Tuple of Vectors
     - A `mixed-strategy profile` for a 2-player game that assigns mixed
       strategy :math:`\boldsymbol{x}` to payer position one and mixed
       strategy :math:`\boldsymbol{y}` to payer position two.
